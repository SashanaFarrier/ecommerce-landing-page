### What I learned

This was my first time working on an ecommerce page. There are many things I didn't know and had to learn about in building out this project. The greatest challenge I faced was when it came to adding functionality to the shopping cart, which included adding to and/or removing items from the cart and updating same.

I learnt a lot about localStorage and how implement its uses when building out my shopping cart.

I also learnt how to build an image slider without the help of any libraries.

Overall, my knowledge base has expanded and I am grateful for opportunity to have completed this project.

### Continued development

I want to continue building ecommerce pages and image sliders until I fully understand how to work with them.

### Useful resources

**[freeCodeCamp](https://youtu.be/cT_ZYrS3tKc)** - This has helped me a lot in understanding how to build out the functionality of a shopping cart. The totorial was easy to understand and follow. I will refer back to this for future use.
